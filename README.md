# Semantic similarity of sentences using Google's Universal Sentence Embeddings

This code was copied from https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/hub/blob/master/examples/colab/semantic_similarity_with_tf_hub_universal_encoder.ipynb#scrollTo=MSeY-MUQo2Ha

with changes to:

- work on my Linux laptop with a GeForce GTX 1070 that only has 8GB of video RAM
- code added to print out similarity for pairs of test sentences
